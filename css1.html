    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
   <ul> <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
<li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
<li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
<li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li></ul>

<h3>Why Use CSS?</h3>
   <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices <br>
    and screen sizes.</p>

<h5>CSS Example</h5>
<p>body {<br>
  background-color: lightblue;<br>
}<br>

h1 {<br>
  color: white;<br>
  text-align: center;<br>
}<br>

p {<br>
  font-family: verdana;<br>
  font-size: 20px;<br>
}</p>
<h3>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h3>
<p><xmp>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
    
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
    
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    
When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers.
Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
    
To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
    
CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</xmp></p>
<h3>CSS Saves a Lot of Work! </h3>
<p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.<br>
With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>

<!-- <a href=" " class="previous">&laquo; Previous</a> -->
<a href="css2.html" class="next">Next &raquo;</a>
